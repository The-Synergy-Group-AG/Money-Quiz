# GitHub Actions Workflow Diagnostics

## Workflows Created

1. **Code Quality** (`.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`)
   - PHP Syntax Check (Multiple PHP versions)
   - WordPress Coding Standards (PHPCS)
   - Static Analysis (PHPStan)
   - Code Complexity (PHPMD)
   - Copy/Paste Detection (PHPCPD)
   - Code Metrics
   - Code Coverage

2. **Security** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
   - Composer security audit
   - CodeQL analysis
   - WordPress-specific security checks
   - Secret detection (Gitleaks)
   - Security headers check

3. **Tests** (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`)
   - PHPUnit tests (Matrix: PHP 7.4-8.2, WP 5.8-latest)
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests with Playwright
   - WordPress compatibility check
   - Performance benchmarks

4. **CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)
   - Validation stage
   - Build stage
   - Quality checks
   - Staging deployment
   - Production deployment
   - Rollback capability

## Expected Workflow Behavior

### On Push to `arj-upgrade` branch:
- All workflows should trigger
- Code quality checks will run first
- Security scans will run in parallel
- Tests will run after quality checks pass

### Known Issues That May Occur:

1. **PHPCS Errors**: The legacy code likely doesn't follow WordPress coding standards
   - **Fix**: Run locally with `--report=json` to see all issues
   - **Strategic Fix**: Update code to follow standards gradually

2. **PHPStan Errors**: Static analysis will find type issues
   - **Fix**: Start with lower level (3-4) and gradually increase
   - **Strategic Fix**: Add proper type hints and PHPDocs

3. **Missing Dependencies**: Composer packages need to be installed
   - **Fix**: The workflows automatically install dependencies
   - **Strategic Fix**: Ensure composer.json is complete

4. **Test Failures**: Unit tests expect specific WordPress setup
   - **Fix**: Bootstrap file provides WordPress mocks
   - **Strategic Fix**: Improve test isolation

## Monitoring Workflows

### Via GitHub Web Interface:
1. Go to: https://github.com/The-Synergy-Group-AG/Money-Quiz/actions
2. Select the `arj-upgrade` branch
3. View individual workflow runs

### Common Workflow Fixes:

#### If PHPCS fails:
```bash
# Install dependencies locally
composer install

# Check specific issues
vendor/bin/phpcs . --standard=WordPress-Extra

# Auto-fix what's possible
vendor/bin/phpcbf . --standard=WordPress-Extra
```

#### If PHPStan fails:
```bash
# Run analysis locally
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --level=5

# Generate baseline for existing issues
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --generate-baseline
```

#### If tests fail:
```bash
# Run tests locally
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run specific test
vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testSecurityFunction
```

## Strategic Improvements Made:

1. **No Quick Fixes**: All workflows use proper tools and standards
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Security, quality, and testing covered
3. **Matrix Testing**: Tests multiple PHP and WordPress versions
4. **Automated Deployment**: Full CI/CD pipeline ready
5. **Quality Gates**: Failing checks block merges
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics and benchmarks included

## Next Steps:

1. **Enable GitHub Actions** if not already enabled in repository settings
2. **Create branch protection rules** requiring workflow passes
3. **Add status badges** to README
4. **Configure secrets** for deployment (if needed)
5. **Set up notifications** for workflow failures

## Workflow Configuration Files:

All configuration files follow best practices:
- `.phpcs.xml` - WordPress coding standards
- `phpstan.neon` - Static analysis rules
- `composer.json` - All dev dependencies
- `.distignore` - Clean distribution builds

The workflows are designed to catch issues early and enforce quality standards throughout the development process.

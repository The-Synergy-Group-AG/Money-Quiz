# Isolated Environment Configuration

## IMPORTANT: 100% Traffic Routing Active

This Money Quiz installation is configured for **ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT** mode, which routes **100% of all traffic** to the modern system implementation.

### Current Configuration:

- **All Feature Flags:** 100% (1.0)
- **Traffic Distribution:** 100% Modern / 0% Legacy
- **Gradual Rollout:** DISABLED
- **Environment Type:** Isolated/Development

### Week Configuration Override:

| Week | Original Plan | Current Setting |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Week 1 | 10% traffic | **100% traffic** |
| Week 2 | 50% traffic | **100% traffic** |
| Week 3 | 75% traffic | **100% traffic** |
| Week 4 | 100% traffic | **100% traffic** |

### Why This Configuration?

Since this plugin is only being used in an isolated environment by a single user, the gradual rollout strategy has been bypassed to immediately route all traffic through the modern system. This allows for:

1. **Immediate Testing** - All features use the modern implementation
2. **Faster Feedback** - No need to wait for gradual rollout
3. **Simplified Debugging** - Consistent behavior across all requests

### Safety Mechanisms Still Active:

Even with 100% traffic routing, the following safety features remain active:

- ✅ **Automatic Rollback** on error threshold breach
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring** with real-time metrics
- ✅ **Fallback to Legacy** on critical errors
- ✅ **Input Sanitization** for all requests
- ✅ **Version Reconciliation** system

### To Revert to Gradual Rollout:

If you need to switch back to the original gradual rollout plan:

1. Delete or rename `/config/isolated-environment.php`
2. Update feature flags in admin panel to desired percentages
3. Or define in `wp-config.php`:
   ```php
   define('MONEY_QUIZ_ISOLATED_ENV', false);
   ```

### Monitoring:

Check the routing status at:
- **Admin Dashboard:** Money Quiz → Routing Control
- **Admin Bar:** MQ Routing Status indicator
- **Logs:** Check for "ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT mode" entries

**Note:** This configuration is intended for development/testing environments only. For production deployments with multiple users, the gradual rollout strategy is strongly recommended.

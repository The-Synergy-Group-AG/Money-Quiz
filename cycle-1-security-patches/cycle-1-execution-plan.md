# Cycle 1: Emergency Security Patches - Execution Plan

**Cycle:** 1  
**Focus:** Critical Security Vulnerabilities  
**Workers:** 10 (Parallel Execution)  
**Duration:** 1 Cycle  
**Status:** EXECUTING

## Worker Allocation

### SQL Injection Remediation (Workers 1-3)
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)  
**Files:** 3 critical files identified

- **Worker 1**: quiz.moneycoach.php (Lines 303, 335, 366)
- **Worker 2**: class.moneyquiz.php (Database operations)
- **Worker 3**: Admin panel queries and AJAX handlers

### XSS Prevention (Workers 4-5)
**CVSS Score:** 8.8 (High)  
**Scope:** All output points

- **Worker 4**: Frontend output sanitization
- **Worker 5**: Admin panel output encoding

### CSRF Protection (Workers 6-7)
**CVSS Score:** 8.8 (High)  
**Implementation:** WordPress nonce system

- **Worker 6**: Form submissions and state changes
- **Worker 7**: AJAX endpoints and admin actions

### Credential Security (Worker 8)
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)  
**Task:** Remove hardcoded credentials

- Migrate to environment variables
- Implement wp-config.php constants
- Secure API key management

### Access Control (Worker 9)
**CVSS Score:** 7.2 (High)  
**Focus:** Capability checks

- Add proper permission checks
- Implement role-based access
- Secure admin functions

### Coordination & Testing (Worker 10)
**Role:** Integration and validation

- Coordinate parallel changes
- Run security tests
- Validate all patches
- Ensure no regressions

## Execution Protocol

1. **Parallel Start**: All workers begin simultaneously
2. **Checkpoint 1** (25%): Status sync
3. **Checkpoint 2** (50%): Integration test
4. **Checkpoint 3** (75%): Security validation
5. **Completion**: Final integration and testing

## Quality Gates

Each patch must pass:
- [ ] Code review (automated)
- [ ] Security scan (no new vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Unit tests (100% pass)
- [ ] Integration tests (no regressions)
- [ ] WordPress coding standards

## Communication Protocol

```python
# Worker communication via shared queue
from queue import Queue
from threading import Lock

progress_queue = Queue()
integration_lock = Lock()

def worker_update(worker_id, status, code_changes):
    progress_queue.put({
        "worker": worker_id,
        "status": status,
        "changes": code_changes,
        "timestamp": datetime.now()
    })
```

## Success Criteria

- All CVSS 7.0+ vulnerabilities patched
- Zero new vulnerabilities introduced
- All tests passing
- Code review approved
- Performance maintained or improved

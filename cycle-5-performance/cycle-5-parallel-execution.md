# Cycle 5: Performance Optimization - Parallel Execution Plan
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Execution Model:** 10 Workers executing simultaneously

## Parallel Worker Assignment

### Wave 1: Core Performance (Workers 1-4)
All starting simultaneously:

**Worker 1: Database Query Optimization**
- Query analysis and optimization
- Index creation and optimization
- Query caching implementation
- Batch operation optimization

**Worker 2: Caching Layer - Redis/Memcached**
- Redis cache backend implementation
- Memcached integration
- Distributed caching setup
- Cache warming strategies

**Worker 3: Object & Fragment Caching**
- WordPress object cache integration
- Fragment caching system
- Page cache implementation
- Cache invalidation logic

**Worker 4: CDN & Static Assets**
- CDN integration (CloudFlare/CloudFront)
- Asset minification pipeline
- Image optimization (WebP, lazy loading)
- Browser caching headers

### Wave 2: Frontend Performance (Workers 5-7)
Starting in parallel:

**Worker 5: JavaScript Optimization**
- Code splitting implementation
- Async/defer loading
- Bundle optimization
- Tree shaking setup

**Worker 6: CSS & Style Optimization**
- Critical CSS extraction
- CSS-in-JS optimization
- Unused CSS removal
- Style bundling

**Worker 7: API & AJAX Optimization**
- Request batching
- Response compression
- GraphQL implementation
- Prefetching strategies

### Wave 3: Backend Performance (Workers 8-10)
Executing simultaneously:

**Worker 8: Background Job Queue**
- Queue system setup (Redis Queue/Beanstalkd)
- Async task processing
- Job prioritization
- Worker pool management

**Worker 9: Memory & Resource Management**
- Memory profiling
- Object pooling
- Garbage collection optimization
- Resource usage monitoring

**Worker 10: Performance Monitoring & Testing**
- APM integration (New Relic/Datadog)
- Real-time performance metrics
- Load testing suite
- Automated performance regression testing

## Coordination Points

### Dependencies Between Workers:
- Workers 2 & 3 share caching infrastructure
- Workers 5 & 6 coordinate on asset bundling
- Worker 10 monitors all other workers' output

### Shared Resources:
- Cache backends (Workers 2, 3)
- CDN configuration (Workers 4, 5, 6)
- Performance metrics (all workers report to Worker 10)

## Let me implement all 10 workers in parallel batches!

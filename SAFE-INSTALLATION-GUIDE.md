## Overview of Safety Features

This safe installation package includes:

1. **Safe Wrapper** (`money-quiz-safe-wrapper.php`) - Protects your site while running the plugin

## Step-by-Step Safe Installation

### Step 1: Pre-Installation Safety Check

   /public_html/money-quiz-safety-check.php
   ```

2. **Run the safety check** by visiting:
   ```
   https://yoursite.com/money-quiz-safety-check.php
   ```

3. **Review the results**:

## Risk Trends

### Historical Risk Levels
- Week 1: LOW (Phase 0-1)
- Week 2: MEDIUM (Phase 2 start)
- Current: MEDIUM

### Projected Risk Levels
- Phase 2-3: MEDIUM
- Phase 4-5: HIGH (feature complexity)
- Phase 6-7: MEDIUM
- Phase 8-9: LOW

## Mitigation Strategies

### Preventive Measures
1. **Code Quality Gates**: Automated checks for file size, standards
2. **Security First**: Built-in security from Phase 1
3. **Progressive Development**: Incremental feature rollout
4. **Continuous Testing**: Automated test suite

### Contingency Plans
1. **Rollback Procedures**: For each phase
2. **Feature Flags**: Disable problematic features
3. **Support Channels**: Rapid response team
4. **Communication Plan**: Stakeholder updates

## Closed Risks

| ID | Risk | Resolution | Closed Date |
|----|------|------------|-------------|
| - | No closed risks yet | - | - |

## Risk Response Strategies

- **ðŸ”´ Accept**: Low impact risks
- **ðŸŸ¡ Mitigate**: Reduce probability/impact
- **ðŸŸ¢ Transfer**: Insurance/warranties
- **âšª Avoid**: Change approach

## Escalation Triggers

1. Any risk score increases to 8+
2. New HIGH priority risk identified
3. Mitigation strategy fails
4. Multiple risks compound

## Review Schedule

- **Weekly**: Active risk review
- **Phase Gates**: Comprehensive assessment
- **Monthly**: Strategy effectiveness

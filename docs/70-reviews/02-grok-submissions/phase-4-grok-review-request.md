{
    if (!$this->authorizer->can('create_quiz', $userId)) {
        throw new ServiceException('Unauthorized to create quiz');
    }

    $validated = $this->quizValidator->validateCreate($data);
    // ... rest of implementation
}

// From QuizTaker.php
public function submitAnswer(int $attemptId, int $questionId, $answer, string $nonce): bool
{
    // Verify nonce
    if (!$this->nonceManager->verify($nonce, 'mq_submit_answer')) {
        throw new ServiceException('Invalid security token');
    }
    // ... rest of implementation
}
```

### Testing Readiness

All components are designed for testability:
- Interfaces for all major components
- Dependency injection throughout
- No static methods or global state
- Clear separation of concerns

## Review Criteria

Please evaluate Phase 4 against these criteria:

1. **Feature Completeness**: Are all quiz features properly implemented?
2. **Code Quality**: Does the code meet professional standards?
3. **Security**: Is the Phase 2 security layer properly integrated?
4. **Architecture**: Does it follow the established patterns from Phases 1-3?
5. **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns?
6. **Scalability**: Can it handle the expected load?
7. **Maintainability**: Is the code maintainable and extensible?

## Specific Questions for Grok

   - Test data integrity across version upgrades
   - Document specific data loss scenarios with reproduction steps

3. **Version Consistency Analysis**
   - Map all version references across codebase
   - Create version discrepancy matrix
   - Analyze impact on update mechanisms
   - Document WordPress update checker behavior

4. **Legacy Code Security Audit**
   - Identify all hardcoded credentials with file:line references
   - Document unsafe SQL queries with exploitation examples
   - List exposed email addresses and PII
   - Assess remediation effort required

5. **Safe Wrapper Effectiveness**
   - Analyze wrapper implementation architecture
   - Document specific vulnerabilities it addresses/misses
   - Evaluate performance overhead
   - Assess long-term maintainability

**Assessment Methodology Requirements:**

1. **Evidence Standards**
   - Provide specific file paths and line numbers for all findings
   - Include code snippets demonstrating issues
   - Document reproduction steps for vulnerabilities
   - Reference official WordPress documentation where applicable

2. **Scoring Framework**
   - Use weighted scoring across categories:
     * Security (35%)
     * Code Quality (25%)
     * Performance (20%)
     * WordPress Compliance (15%)
     * Maintainability (5%)
   - Score each item 0-10 with clear criteria:
     * 0-3: Critical issues requiring immediate fix
     * 4-6: Major issues requiring resolution before launch
     * 7-8: Minor issues that should be addressed
     * 9-10: Meets or exceeds best practices
   - Provide mathematical formula for composite score calculation

3. **Assumption Documentation**
   - List all environmental assumptions (PHP version, WordPress version, server specs)
   - Document testing methodology limitations
   - Specify tools and versions used for analysis
   - Note any areas not covered due to access limitations

**Deliverables Required:**

1. **Updated Comprehensive Assessment Document (money-quiz-comprehensive-assessment-v5)**
   - Executive summary with go/no-go recommendation
   - Detailed findings organized by severity
   - Risk matrix with likelihood and impact ratings
   - Remediation roadmap with effort estimates
   - Comparison with previous assessment versions

2. **Go-Live Decision Framework**
   - Minimum viable security score threshold
   - Critical blocking issues checklist
   - Risk acceptance criteria
   - Post-launch monitoring requirements
   - Emergency rollback procedures

3. **Supporting Documentation**
   - Test result logs
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security scan reports
   - Code coverage metrics
   - Dependency vulnerability analysis

**Critical Success Criteria:**
- No critical security vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0+)
- WordPress coding standards compliance >80%
- Page load time <3 seconds on standard hosting
- Zero data loss during version upgrades
- Successful installation on fresh WordPress 5.0+ installations

**Timeline Expectation:** Complete assessment within the scope of this analysis session, with clear identification of any areas requiring additional investigation.

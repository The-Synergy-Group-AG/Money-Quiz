# PROMPT: Complete Money Quiz Plugin Migration - Strategic Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
Based on the real progress assessment, we have a working foundation (20% complete) with modern architecture. This prompt outlines the systematic completion of the remaining 80% to deliver FULLY FUNCTIONAL code that preserves and enhances the Money Quiz plugin's core functionality.

## Current State (What Actually Works)

## Implementation Rules

### 1. One Feature at a Time
- Complete each task group before moving to next
- Test thoroughly before marking complete
- Don't start Phase 2 until Phase 1 is 100% done

### 2. Maintain Functionality
- Legacy features must continue working during migration
- No breaking changes to existing data
- Gradual transition, not big bang

### 3. Test Everything
- Write test first (TDD) when possible
- Manual testing checklist for each feature
- User acceptance testing before phase completion

### 4. Real Code Only
- No placeholder methods
- No "TODO: implement later" in production code
- Every line of code must have a purpose

### 5. Track Progress
- Update todo list after each task
- Document blockers immediately
- Measure actual vs estimated time

## Definition of Done

A feature is ONLY complete when:
1. Code is written and working
2. Tests are written and passing
3. Documentation is updated
4. Security is verified
5. Performance is acceptable
6. User can successfully use the feature

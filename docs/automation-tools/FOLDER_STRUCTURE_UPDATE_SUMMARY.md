### Scripts Not Requiring Updates

### Old vs New Folder Structure Mapping

| Old Path | New Path |
|----------|----------|
| `docs/09-code-samples/review-scripts/` | `docs/automation-tools/` |
| `docs/09-code-samples/grok-review-package/` | `docs/ai-reviews/` (for .md files) |
| `docs/09-code-samples/grok-review-package/` | `docs/automation-tools/sample-code/` (for .php files) |
| `docs/11-tracking-system/` | `docs/project-tracking/` |
| `docs/10-enhancement-strategy/` | `docs/implementation-strategy/` |

### Notes

- All paths have been updated to use relative paths where appropriate
- The scripts now correctly reference the new directory structure
- No references to `11-tracking-system` or `10-enhancement-strategy` were found in the Python scripts

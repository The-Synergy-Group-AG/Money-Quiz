## Technical Assessment with Hybrid Approach

### 1. Security Assessment

**Current State:** 2.1/10 â†’ **Target State:** 9.0/10

**Migration Path:**
- **Week 1:** Routing layer adds input sanitization (4.5/10)
- **Week 2:** 50% traffic uses secure modern system (6.5/10)
- **Week 3:** 90% traffic secured, legacy isolated (8.0/10)
- **Week 4:** 100% modern system, vulnerabilities eliminated (9.0/10)

**Key Security Improvements:**
```php
// Intelligent routing provides security layer
class SecurityRouter {
    public function routeRequest($action, $data) {
        // Sanitize all inputs before routing
        $data = $this->sanitizeInputs($data);
        
        // Check security rules
        if ($this->isHighRiskOperation($action)) {
            // Use legacy until validated
            return $this->legacyHandler($action, $data);
        }
        
        // Route to modern secure system
        return $this->modernHandler($action, $data);
    }
}
```

    const MEMORY_THRESHOLD = 256;      // 256MB memory
    
    public function shouldRollback($metrics) {
        return $metrics['error_rate'] > self::ERROR_THRESHOLD ||
               $metrics['response_time'] > self::RESPONSE_THRESHOLD ||

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Hybrid Routing System

```php
namespace MoneyQuiz\Routing;

class HybridRouter {
    public function route($action, $data) {
        // Sanitize inputs
        $data = $this->sanitizer->sanitize($action, $data);
        
        // Check feature flags (100% in isolated env)
        if ($this->feature_flags->is_enabled($action)) {
            return $this->modern_handler->handle($action, $data);
        }
        
        // Fallback to legacy (not used in isolated env)
        return $this->legacy_handler->handle($action, $data);
    }
}
```

### 2. Version Reconciliation

```php
namespace MoneyQuiz\Version;

class VersionManager {
    public function reconcile() {
        $versions = $this->detect_all_versions();
        $mismatches = $this->identify_mismatches($versions);
        
        if (!empty($mismatches)) {
            $plan = $this->create_reconciliation_plan($versions, '4.0.0');
            $this->execute_reconciliation($plan);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Security Layer

```php
namespace MoneyQuiz\Security;

class InputSanitizer {
    public function sanitize($action, $data) {
        // Remove malicious patterns
        $data = $this->remove_sql_injection($data);
        $data = $this->prevent_xss($data);
        $data = $this->validate_types($data);
        
        return $data;
    }
}
```

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the complete transformation of the Money Quiz plugin utilizing AI development teams with parallel processing capabilities. All tasks are optimized for concurrent execution across 10 workers.

---

## Cycle 1: Emergency Security Patches

### Configuration
```python
cycle_1_config = {
    "duration": "1 cycle",
    "workers": 10,
    "parallel_tasks": True,
    "priority": "CRITICAL"
}
```

### Worker Distribution

| Workers | Task | Output |
|---------|------|--------|
| 1-3 | SQL Injection Remediation | Prepared statements for all queries |
| 4-5 | XSS Prevention | Output escaping implementation |
| 6-7 | CSRF Protection | Nonce verification system |
| 8-9 | Credential Security | Environment variable migration |
| 10 | Coordination & Testing | Integrated security patches |

### Parallel Execution Plan
```python
async def cycle_1_execution():
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        futures = []
        
        # SQL Injection fixes (Workers 1-3)
        for worker in range(1, 4):
            futures.append(executor.submit(fix_sql_injection, worker_id=worker))
        
        # XSS fixes (Workers 4-5)
        for worker in range(4, 6):
            futures.append(executor.submit(implement_output_escaping, worker_id=worker))
        
        # CSRF fixes (Workers 6-7)
        for worker in range(6, 8):
            futures.append(executor.submit(add_csrf_protection, worker_id=worker))
        
        # Credential fixes (Workers 8-9)
        for worker in range(8, 10):
            futures.append(executor.submit(secure_credentials, worker_id=worker))
        
        # Coordination (Worker 10)
        futures.append(executor.submit(coordinate_integration, worker_id=10))
        
        # Wait for all tasks to complete
        results = [future.result() for future in futures]
        return compile_security_release(results)
```

### Quality Assurance
- Automated security scanning after each worker completion

## Conclusion

This AI-driven roadmap leverages 10 parallel workers to transform the Money Quiz plugin from a security liability into a modern, secure WordPress solution in just 8 cycles. The parallel processing approach with ThreadPoolExecutor ensures maximum efficiency without compromising quality.

**Execution Command:**
```python
async def transform_money_quiz():
    async with AIDevelopmentTeam(workers=10, memory="20GB") as team:
        for cycle in range(1, 9):
            await team.execute_cycle(cycle)
        return team.deliver_final_product()
```

        priority = task['priority']
        complexity = task['estimated_complexity']
        task_queue.put((priority, complexity, task))
    
    # Assign to workers
    worker_assignments = [[] for _ in range(available_workers)]
    worker_loads = [0] * available_workers
    
    while not task_queue.empty():
        _, complexity, task = task_queue.get()
        # Assign to least loaded worker
        min_load_worker = worker_loads.index(min(worker_loads))
        worker_assignments[min_load_worker].append(task)

- Prepared statement enforcement
- Query parameterization
- Stored procedure security
- Database access layer hardening

#### Worker 6: Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection ❌
- Request rate limiting
- IP-based throttling
- Distributed attack mitigation
- Resource consumption limits

#### Worker 7: Security Headers & HTTPS ❌
- HSTS implementation (partial in session-hardening.php)
- Security header configuration
- Certificate pinning
- Mixed content prevention

### Wave 3: Monitoring & Testing (Workers 8-10)
All components from Wave 3 are missing:

#### Worker 8: Audit Logging ❌
- Security event logging (partial implementation in auth files)
- User activity tracking
- Compliance reporting
- Log integrity protection

#### Worker 9: Vulnerability Scanning ❌
- Automated security scanning
- Dependency checking
- Configuration auditing
- Penetration testing tools

#### Worker 10: Security Testing Suite ❌

- Automated security regression tests

## Summary

### Completed (2/10 Workers):
1. ✅ Worker 1: Authentication & Authorization (100% complete)
2. ✅ Worker 2: Data Encryption (75% complete - key-management.php needs completion)

### Empty/Missing (8/10 Workers):
3. ❌ Worker 3: Input Validation & Sanitization (0% - empty directory)
4. ❌ Worker 4: CSRF & XSS Protection (0% - empty directory)
5. ❌ Worker 5: SQL Injection Prevention (0% - not started)
6. ❌ Worker 6: Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection (0% - not started)
7. ❌ Worker 7: Security Headers & HTTPS (0% - not started)
8. ❌ Worker 8: Audit Logging (0% - not started)
9. ❌ Worker 9: Vulnerability Scanning (0% - not started)
10. ❌ Worker 10: Security Testing Suite (0% - not started)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority:
1. Complete `key-management.php` implementation
2. Implement CSRF/XSS protection files (Worker 4)
3. Implement Input Validation files (Worker 3)

### Next Steps:
4. Create SQL injection prevention module
5. Implement rate limiting system
6. Set up comprehensive audit logging
7. Create security testing framework

### Integration Needs:
- Ensure all security components integrate with the existing authentication system
- Create unified security configuration
- Implement centralized security event monitoring
- Set up automated security scanning pipeline

## Security Strengths (What's Done Well)
- Comprehensive authentication system with MFA, OAuth, and SAML
- Strong session security with fingerprinting and encryption
- Well-designed RBAC system with granular permissions
- Good encryption foundation with key rotation support
- Consistent use of database tables for audit trails
- Proper error handling and logging throughout

## Critical Gaps
- No input validation or sanitization
- No CSRF or XSS protection
- No SQL injection prevention layer
- No rate limiting or DDoS protection
- No automated security testing
- Incomplete key management system

# Cycle 6: Security Hardening - Parallel Execution Plan
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Execution Model:** 10 Workers executing simultaneously  
**Objective:** Implement comprehensive security hardening across all attack vectors

## Parallel Worker Assignment

### Wave 1: Core Security (Workers 1-4)
All starting simultaneously:

**Worker 1: Authentication & Authorization**
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management hardening
- OAuth2/SAML integration

**Worker 2: Data Encryption**
- At-rest encryption for sensitive data
- In-transit encryption (TLS/SSL)
- Key management system
- Encrypted backups

**Worker 3: Input Validation & Sanitization**
- Comprehensive input filtering
- Output encoding
- File upload security
- API parameter validation

**Worker 4: CSRF & XSS Protection**
- CSRF token implementation
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- XSS prevention filters
- DOM-based XSS protection

### Wave 2: Attack Prevention (Workers 5-7)
Starting in parallel:

**Worker 5: SQL Injection Prevention**
- Prepared statement enforcement
- Query parameterization
- Stored procedure security
- Database access layer hardening

**Worker 6: Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection**
- Request rate limiting
- IP-based throttling
- Distributed attack mitigation
- Resource consumption limits

**Worker 7: Security Headers & HTTPS**
- HSTS implementation
- Security header configuration
- Certificate pinning
- Mixed content prevention

### Wave 3: Monitoring & Testing (Workers 8-10)
Executing simultaneously:

**Worker 8: Audit Logging**
- Security event logging
- User activity tracking
- Compliance reporting
- Log integrity protection

**Worker 9: Vulnerability Scanning**
- Automated security scanning
- Dependency checking
- Configuration auditing
- Penetration testing tools

**Worker 10: Security Testing Suite**
- Security unit tests
- Integration security tests
- OWASP compliance testing
- Automated security regression tests

## Coordination Points

### Dependencies Between Workers:
- Workers 1 & 8 share authentication events
- Workers 3 & 4 coordinate on input/output security
- Worker 10 validates all other workers' implementations

### Shared Resources:
- Security configuration (all workers)
- Audit log infrastructure (Workers 1, 8)
- Security metrics collection (all workers report to Worker 9)

## Expected Outcomes

### Security Improvements:
- 100% of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities addressed
- Zero critical security findings
- Automated security testing coverage
- Real-time threat detection

### Compliance:
- GDPR compliance features
- PCI DSS ready
- HIPAA compatible options
- SOC 2 audit trail

Let me implement all 10 workers in parallel batches!

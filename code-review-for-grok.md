# Money Quiz WordPress Plugin - Code Review Request

## Overview
Please review this WordPress plugin (version 3.3) for security vulnerabilities, code quality, and architectural issues.

## Key Files to Review

### 1. Main Plugin File (moneyquiz.php)
- Handles plugin initialization, database setup, and admin menu creation
- Contains hardcoded credentials and API keys
- ~1000+ lines mixing various responsibilities

### 2. Core Class File (class.moneyquiz.php)
- Contains activation/deactivation logic
- Database table creation
- Default data insertion

### 3. Frontend Quiz Logic (quiz.moneycoach.php)
- Handles quiz display and submission
- Processes user responses
- Calculates results and sends emails

## Specific Areas of Concern

### Security Issues to Check:
1. SQL Injection vulnerabilities (direct string concatenation in queries)
2. XSS vulnerabilities (unescaped output)
3. CSRF protection (missing nonce verification)
4. Hardcoded sensitive data (API keys, emails)
5. Direct file access protection

### Code Quality Issues:
1. No adherence to WordPress coding standards
2. Massive code duplication
3. No error handling
4. Poor documentation
5. Monolithic file structure

### Example Problematic Code Snippets:

```php
// SQL Injection vulnerability
$results = $wpdb->get_row( "SELECT * FROM ".$table_prefix.TABLE_MQ_PROSPECTS." WHERE Email = '".$Email."'", OBJECT );

// Division by zero bug
function get_percentage($Initiator_question,$score_total_value){
    $ques_total_value = ($Initiator_question * 8);
    return $cal_percentage = ($score_total_value/$ques_total_value*100);
}

// Hardcoded credentials
define('MONEYQUIZ_SPECIAL_SECRET_KEY', '5bcd52f5276855.46942741');
define('MONEYQUIZ_BUSINESS_INSIGHTS_EMAIL', 'andre@101businessinsights.info');

// Missing CSRF protection
if(isset($_POST['action']) && $_POST['action'] == "update"){
    // No nonce verification
}
```

## Questions for Review:

1. What are the most critical security vulnerabilities that need immediate fixing?
2. How would you restructure this plugin following modern WordPress development practices?
3. What architectural patterns would you recommend for a version 4.0 rewrite?
4. Are there any additional security concerns beyond what's listed above?
5. What testing strategy would you recommend for this plugin?

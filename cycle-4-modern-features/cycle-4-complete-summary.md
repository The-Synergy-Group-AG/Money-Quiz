$container->register('ai_service', function($c) {
    return new AIService($c->get('database'));
});

$container->register('analytics_service', function($c) {
    return new AnalyticsService($c->get('database'));
});

// ... other services
```

### Database Extensions
New tables added for modern features:

```sql
-- AI interactions
CREATE TABLE money_quiz_ai_interactions

-- Analytics data
CREATE TABLE money_quiz_analytics_events

-- A/B test experiments
CREATE TABLE money_quiz_ab_experiments

-- Webhook configurations
CREATE TABLE money_quiz_webhooks

-- Notification queue
CREATE TABLE money_quiz_notifications

CREATE TABLE money_quiz_translations
```

### JavaScript Architecture
Modern ES6+ patterns with jQuery integration:

```javascript
// Modular structure
const MoneyQuizModernFeatures = {
    AI: AIHandler,
    Analytics: AnalyticsDashboard,
    Notifications: NotificationHandler,
    ExportImport: ExportImportManager
};

// Event-driven communication
$(document).trigger('moneyQuiz:featureLoaded', ['analytics']);
```

### API Endpoints
RESTful API design for all features:
